# Python Firewall Project

This project is a simple Python-based firewall built using Scapy to monitor and filter network traffic based on IPs and ports.

## Features
- Monitor incoming network traffic using Scapy.
- Block traffic to specific ports based on defined rules.
- Allow all IP addresses (no IP filtering), but log and filter traffic based on allowed ports.
- Real-time logging of both blocked and allowed traffic.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Scapy (a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **Scapy** installed via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```
